## ✨ Development Highlights

1. **Synchronized Loading System (UX):** Implementation of a global loading manager that pre-loads background videos and high-resolution images. Content is only displayed once the media is fully ready, eliminating white/black "flashes" and ensuring a smooth fade-in entrance.
2. **Seamless Navigation:** A custom page transition system that leverages component mounting states to maintain visual immersion while navigating between routes.
3. **Optimized SEO & Sharing:** Advanced Open Graph and `metadataBase` configuration, ensuring that when sharing links on WhatsApp, Instagram, or LinkedIn, the thumbnail (banner) and description appear correctly.
4. **Clean & Minimalist Interface:** Media-focused design (photos and music), featuring a hidden custom scrollbar and optimized galleries with Lightbox support.
5. **Scalable Architecture:** A structure prepared for easy addition of new languages and content modules (e.g., tour dates or new releases).

## 🚀 Technical Optimizations

- **Media Pre-fetching:** Custom React hooks to monitor the readiness of background videos and images.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Intelligent timeouts that guarantee content display even on unstable network connections.
- **Dynamic i18n:** Automatic locale detection and canonical URL management for superior search engine indexing (SEO).
